Smriti is a local-first, privacy-focused application designed to analyze and visualize personal journal entries. It was born out of a desire to understand my own thoughts, discover patterns in my thinking, and push data analysis to its limits on the roughtly 500 digital Journal Entries I have made between August 2021 and July 2025.

This project is currently in **early and active development**.
