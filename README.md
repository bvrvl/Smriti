### Current Status

**Smriti is in active early development.**  
The codebase is evolving rapidly. Features may break, change, or disappear. This is not yet ready for general use — but you're welcome to explore or contribute.

---

Smriti is a personal data analytics project — built out of a desire to explore, analyze, and visualize over **500 digital journal entries** written between **August 2021 and July 2025**.  
It’s an ongoing experiment in self-reflection, data analysis, and pushing the limits of personal insight through software.

---
Smriti will always be local, private, and smart in handling sensitive data.

*   **Zero Persistence:** No data is ever saved to your disk by the application. The database exists only in the container's temporary memory and is **completely destroyed** when you shut down the app.

*   **No Cloud:** No data is ever sent to the cloud. All processing happens locally.

### Contributing

Contributions, ideas, and feedback are always welcome.  
If you find a bug or have a feature request, feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request.
